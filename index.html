        <p class="note">Hehe I know this is very late (muh mat banao saale). I'm sorry. I wanted to make this before your birthday but I wasn't able to. BUT here I am, trying hehe. You know you're one of my first friends in college and also managed to stay too(i hope so?).I still vividly remember the first day we met, your "shudh hindi", your antics, all of it was really fun. That interaction made me feel that maybe i'll be find my way here too. One of my favourite things about our friendship is the comfort u offer. It has always been so comforting to have you around. Second year we made so many memories, I love every second of it. Even the fights. I don't regret having u as a close friend. ever. Yk u don't know how much you have helped me and how much I appreciate u. You have kinda pulled me away from a bad place twice. Once in first year and once in second. In the beginning of first year, I had no proper friends. Everyone was so into dating, it made me feel so lonely there. But u showed up everyday, pulled me out of my room. I guess I never really realised how much it was needed. You also did the same in second year when I drifted apart from rudransh and all. I was really lonely in the beginning and again, you showed up for me. Thank you Sadhu. I know you don't believe I gave u as much importance, I'm sorry for making u feel that way. But you were and are important to me. I never meant to take u for granted. But if I did, I'm sorry. You became a constant in my life and I miss that now. I always miss u in the most random moments, in class, when chasing sunsets, travel reels or planning or so much more. I guess I just wanted to tell you how much u mean to me. (I tried). I know this is a very bad attempt at doing something special for you. I hope u like it. I know it can be much better but itna hi aata hai mereko hehe.
I miss you.   </p>
